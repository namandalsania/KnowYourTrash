# KnowYourTrash

The app classifies bio waste and non-bio waste through image classification using deep learning. The goal of the project is to create a custom CNN algorithm that can find and sort trash into two categories: Recyclable and Organic.

This model classifies the image way faster and with greater accuracy than the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLO, ResNet and SSD.

We have also implemented CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve the feature representation of images.

The research paper is currently being reviewed for publication in an IEEE journal and is expected to be published in October.
