# KnowYourTrash

The app classifies bio waste and non-bio waste through image classification using deep learning. The goal of the project is to create a custom CNN algorithm that can find and sort trash into two categories: Recyclable and Organic.

This model aims to output the answer in much better time and with greater accuracy than the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLO, ResNet and SSD.

We have implemented CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve the feature representation of images.
