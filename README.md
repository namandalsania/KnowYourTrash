# KnowYourTrash

The app classifies bio waste and non-bio waste through image classification using deep learning. The goal of the project is to create a custom CNN algorithm that can find and sort trash into two categories: Recyclable and Organic.

This model classifies the image way faster and with greater accuracy than the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLO, Faster-RCNN and SSD.

We have also implemented CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve the feature representation of images.

<em>Dataset</em>:&nbsp;<br>
We sourced most data from this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data) dataset and manually collected the rest using our smartphone cameras.

&nbsp;<br>
The research paper is currently being reviewed for publication in an IEEE journal and is expected to be published in October.
